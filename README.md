# ATP Statistics 🎾

Source code for the [atp-stats](https://atp-stats.onrender.com/) tennis webapp built in [Python Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) and currently deployed on [Render](https://www.heroku.com/), using Docker.

The goal is to display most of what appears in the Official ATP Tour website in a colorful and more intuitive (to me) manner.

## Data Attribution 📁

The data used here is (part of) the amazing dataset created by [**Jeff Sackmann**](http://www.jeffsackmann.com/)
(Check out his [github repository](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)), he's the real MVP.

In particular, I am using atp tour-level main draw single matches from 1995 to present day.

## Bugs 🐞
This is a side project which I had fun developing, mostly on weekends, for personal use.
Therefore I am sure it is possible to find bugs and non-working interactions.
