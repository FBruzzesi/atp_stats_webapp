**Data Attribution:** The data used here is (part of) the amazing dataset created by [**Jeff Sackmann**](http://www.jeffsackmann.com/) 
(Check out his [github repository](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp))

**Data Usage:** In particular, I am using atp tour-level main draw single matches from 1995 to present day. I am currently working towards an independent data gathering solution.

**Bug Fix:** This is a MVP which I had fun developing, mostly on weekends, for personal use. Therefore I am sure it is possible to find bugs and non-working interactions. 
If you find any or just want to get in touch with me, please feel free to reach out by [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-bruzzesi/)

**Support:** I would love to grow the project, if you feel like supporting, you can [buy me a coffee â˜•](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fbruzzesi)
